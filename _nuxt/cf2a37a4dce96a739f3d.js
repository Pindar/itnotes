I hope this is helpful to anyone who couldn\'t attend and it helps me to remember.\n\nThe first thing which impressed myself was the amazing location. It happened at the Lucerna Cinema in Prague; for whom doesn\'t know what I\'m talking about just have a look at the [pictures](https://goo.gl/photos/atdWtMWyW7KyNRhdA).\n\nOverall it was very well organized and they improved things even while the event happened. For instance on the first day there wasn\'t enough space to have proper lunch but this was different on the second day by opening an additional room. Well done! Speaking of food: as at most of the developer / computer science conferences there was plenty and good food, coffee and drinks. Yummy.\n\nBut surly I wasn\'t attending because of food and drinks. Talkwise there was a big variety in terms of topics but sadly there wasn\'t a big diversity in terms of gender. There were apparently many more men talking than women. Surprisingly to me especially because I had the feeling that the proportion of women attended the conference was pretty high compared what I\'ve seen at developer conferences so far. So I\'m convinced to see more women on stage next year.\n\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have more than 500 people from 43 countries at <a href="https://twitter.com/MLPrague">@mlprague</a>.

Please bear with me in case I skipped yours.\n\n### Vertical AI: Solving full-stack industry problems that require subject matter expertise, unique data, and a product that uses AI to deliver its core value proposition\n\nBy Bradford Cross, DCVC (USA). This talk inspired me a lot. He mentioned that engineers tend to apply the engineering knowledge first to their very own craft. This seems to me somehow true and at the same time it\'s an opportunity to change it. Bringing engineering / science mindsets to a variety of industries will help to add another dimension to see things from a totally different angle.\n\nThe only problem I see in this path is that in my feeling only tech companies appreciate the value of engineers and scientists enough and therefore a lot of companies don\'t have engineers at c-level. My personal assumption is that companies with people having an engineering/science background in the c-level will overcome the competition in the long run because they making use of more advanced technology and science. But this are just my personal thoughts and where not part of the talk.\n\n\n### Data Science at The New York Times\n\nBy Chris Wiggins, New York Times (USA) -- my personal favorite. He gave good general advice and was inspiring at the same time. For example he mentioned that they integrated their Machine Learning tool as slack bot. With it you get the power of ML to marketies and journalists without friction. Here a selection of tweets which reflect very well what I mean:\n\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Data science at The New York Times or &quot;Every publisher is now a startup&quot;. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mlprague?src=hash">#mlprague</a> <a href="https://t.co/fNps2D4EDH">pic.twitter.com/fNps2D4EDH</a></p>&mdash; Kateřina Veselovská (@kveselovska) <a href="https://twitter.com/kveselovska/status/855695156581945345">April 22, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"><\/script>\n\n\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/chrishwiggins">@chrishwiggins</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mlprague?src=hash">#mlprague</a> descriptive, predictive, prescriptive -&gt; use the language people get :) <a href="https://t.co/eKlB2yPxmF">pic.twitter.com/eKlB2yPxmF</a></p>&mdash; Andrej Danko (@DankoAndrej) <a href="https://twitter.com/DankoAndrej/status/855693933007040513">April 22, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"><\/script>\n\n\n### Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit: fast and furious\n\nBy Willi Richert, Microsoft (DE).

"How human chat agents can help chatbots to get smarter, and how ML can help human chat agents to be more productive." Since chat bots aren\'t as good as humans when it comes to customer service yet it\'s definitely a good idea to combine the best of both worlds. Not sure if Chatler is the best product doing this but certainty the idea it reasonable.\n\n\n### TensorFlow & Deep Learning\n\nBy Yufeng Guo, Google (USA).

Clearly an important topic to discuss the ethical aspects of AI and especially of Artificial General Intelligence. I remember he said something like we will have basically two options: a) we get uploaded somehow to such a system or b) we are becoming Cyborgs. In case of (a) we are loosing most of the things a human is today (eating, sex, etc) in case of (b) the system will get rid of us when it\'s getting too smart. Who attaches a 486 PC to an iPhone? Nobody does. Why should a super intelligence attach a human in the long run?\n\nCertainly a lot of worth points to be discussed.\n\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Children are untrained neural networks deployed on real data.&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/romanyam">@romanyam</a> about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AI?src=hash">#AI</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/security?src=hash">#security</a> and near future <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MLPrague?src=hash">#MLPrague</a> <a href="https://t.co/hXBfil1V0q">pic.twitter.com/hXBfil1V0q</a></p>&mdash; Stanislav Rejthar (@s_rejthar) <a href="https://twitter.com/s_rejthar/status/856087512086958080">April 23, 2017</a></blockquote>\n<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"><\/script>\n\n### DeepStack: Expert-Level Artificial Intelligence in No-Limit Poker\n\nBy Martin Schmid, IBM (CZ).

How to apply AI in network security could be seen in this talk. And analysing network traffic is in particular harder than normal AI problems because you don\'t have just one vector as training set, you have multiple different ones. I have to emphasis that his Q/A session was in particular informative and a little bit funny at the same time.
