<blockquote>
  <p>Backbone Aura is a decoupled, event-driven architecture on top of Backbone.js for developing widget-based applications. It takes advantage of patterns and best practices for developing maintainable applications and gives you greater control over widget-based development. Aura gives you complete control of a widgetâ€™s lifecycle, allowing developers to dynamically start, stop, reload and clean-up parts of their application as needed.</p>
