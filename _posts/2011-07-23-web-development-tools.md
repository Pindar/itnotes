  content: Interesting work on this framework.I have been crouius about something.
    Why have you chosen to support both Selenium and Watir with this framework? I
    ask because it seems like with Watir-WebDriver, you can drop down into Selenium
    if you need to (via @browser.driver, for example). Watir seems to present a nicer
    way to chain methods and is a bit more readable than Selenium.I realize your framework
    is providing a sort of common platform for the two libraries, but I was just wondering
    what motivated you to want to go a  common platform  approach   i.e., support
    both as opposed to just one?

<p>Development-tools are very helpful. I give you a short list with useful web development tools which I use in my daily work:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">eclipse</a> is one of the greatest development-IDE which I know.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3/download">aptana plug in</a>. Absolutely necessary for web developer who work with eclipse.</li>
<li><a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jslint-eclipse-plugin">JSLint validation plug-in</a>. You want the good parts of JavaScript? Then you need this plug-in!</li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> / svn plug-in. You know why...</li><br />
</ul></p>
<ul>
<li>Build tool: <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant</a>. You can also use "make" but I prefer "ant" because it doesn't depend on an operating system.</li>
<li>Unit tests: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/">JSTestDriver</a> combined with sinon.js. Awesome! (btw. you should read <a href="http://tddjs.com/">Test driven JavaScript development.</a>)</li>
<li>Acceptance tests: <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>, <a href="http://watir.com/">Watir</a>. I use Selenium but i read that watir should be a bit better... If you know more about please share your experience in the comments below.</li>
<li>Debugging: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/firebug/">Firebug</a>-Plug-in and the build-in capabilities in google chrome.</li>
<li>Performance: <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">YSlow</a>. Every web developer should know it.</li>
<li>Continuous integration: <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>.</li>
<li>JavaScript/CSS compressor: <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/">YUI-compressor</a></li><br />
</ul></p>
