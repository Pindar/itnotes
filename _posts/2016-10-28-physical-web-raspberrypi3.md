Lately I stumbled over [Google's Eddystone][https://developers.google.com/beacons/] protocol and how it brings the word wide web to the physical world or the other
way around: how it enhances physical things with the internet. This idea is nothing new: there was/is RFID/NFC or even barcodes.
What I can see as real advantage of the [physical web][https://google.github.io/physical-web/] compared to these other technologies is that you get contextual information without opening any app or touching a specific physical thing.

Real contextual information is possible without being disturbed by push notifications. For instance you are waiting in public office area. Now you can pick up a digital ticket just as you enter or you get finally the online self care service shown.
An other good show case might be a train station which shows you the delays etc.
Means there are plenty of opportunities!

The good news are you can set-up a basic physical web experiment just within minutes if you have a Raspberry PI 3 with Jessie:

1. Enable Bluetooth `sudo hciconfig hci0 up`
1. Advertise and not-connectable `sudo hciconfig hci0 leadv 3`
1. Generate [Eddystone URL][https://github.com/google/eddystone/tree/master/eddystone-url] and call it http://yencarnacion.github.io/eddystone-url-calculator/
(only HTTPS target URLs are working: http -> https works, https -> http doesn't)
